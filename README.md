# Highlights:
- The website showcases a range of house models in a visually appealing way. The user-friendly interface allows visitors to quickly find the information they need by click the see more button to view additional information of the house.
- I implemented loops and modals using JavaScript and Bootstrap. This allows users to browse through all available models and view more details about each one. The modals provide a clear and concise view of important information such as the Name, Location, nearest Landmark, and Asking Price of the House.
